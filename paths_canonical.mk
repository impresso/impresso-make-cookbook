# INPUT PATHS FOR CANONICAL FILES FOR PAGES OF A SPECIFIC NEWSPAPER
#
# Defines paths and variables for accessing newspaper files on S3 in the impresso
# canonical format that are used for local synchronization and processing.
#
# PROVIDER HANDLING:
# ==================
# If NEWSPAPER_HAS_PROVIDER is set to 1, paths include PROVIDER level:
#   - PROVIDER must be set explicitly, or
#   - NEWSPAPER should be in PROVIDER/NEWSPAPER format (e.g., BL/WTCH)
#
# If NEWSPAPER_HAS_PROVIDER is 0, paths use NEWSPAPER directly without PROVIDER.
