## Release Workflow

### Overview

Releases follow these general steps:

1. **Prepare**: Review changes, update documentation, and test
2. **Tag**: Create a git tag with the version number
3. **Document**: Write comprehensive release notes
4. **Publish**: Create a GitHub release
5. **Announce**: Notify users and update installation instructions

## Version Numbering

This project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (SemVer):

```
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
```

- **MAJOR**: Incompatible API changes or breaking changes
- **MINOR**: New features, backwards-compatible
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes, backwards-compatible

### Examples

- `1.0.0` → `2.0.0`: Breaking change (e.g., removed support for Python 3.10)
- `1.0.0` → `1.1.0`: New feature (e.g., added topic modeling pipeline)
- `1.0.0` → `1.0.1`: Bug fix (e.g., fixed S3 synchronization issue)

### Pre-release Versions

Pre-release versions can be tagged with additional labels:

- `1.1.0-alpha.1`: Early testing version
- `1.1.0-beta.1`: Feature-complete, testing phase
- `1.1.0-rc.1`: Release candidate, final testing

## Preparing a Release

### 1. Review Changes

```bash
# Compare with the last release tag
git log v1.0.0..HEAD --oneline

# Review file changes
git diff v1.0.0..HEAD --stat

# Check what's changed in specific areas
git log v1.0.0..HEAD --oneline -- lib/
git log v1.0.0..HEAD --oneline -- "*.mk"
```

### 2. Update Documentation

- [ ] Update `CHANGELOG.md` with all changes since the last release
- [ ] Update `README.md` if there are new features or changes to usage
- [ ] Review and update any outdated documentation
- [ ] Ensure all new features have documentation

### 3. Update Version References

Check and update version references in:
- [ ] `README.md` (installation instructions)
- [ ] `lib/pyproject.toml` (Python package version)
- [ ] Any hardcoded version strings in scripts

### 4. Test the Release

Run comprehensive tests:

```bash
# Test setup
make setup

# Test key pipelines
make test-aws
make check-spacy-pipelines
make check-python-installation

# Test a small newspaper if possible
make newspaper NEWSPAPER=test_newspaper LOGGING_LEVEL=DEBUG
```

git log v1.0.0..HEAD --oneline -- "*_lingproc.mk"

# Get commit authors
git shortlog v1.0.0..HEAD -sn

# Get file statistics
git diff v1.0.0..HEAD --stat

# List new files
git diff v1.0.0..HEAD --name-status | grep "^A"

# List modified files
git diff v1.0.0..HEAD --name-status | grep "^M"
```

## Publishing a Release

### 1. Create Git Tag

```bash
# Create an annotated tag
git tag -a v1.1.0 -m "Release v1.1.0: Description"

# Push the tag
git push origin v1.1.0
```

### 2. Create GitHub Release

#### Via GitHub Web Interface

1. Go to https://github.com/impresso/impresso-make-cookbook/releases
2. Click "Draft a new release"
3. Select the tag you just created
4. Fill in the release title: `v1.1.0` or descriptive name
5. Paste your release notes in the description
6. Check "Set as a pre-release" if applicable
7. Click "Publish release"

#### Via GitHub CLI

```bash
# Install gh CLI if needed
# brew install gh  # macOS
# apt install gh   # Ubuntu

# Authenticate
gh auth login

# Create release from release notes file
gh release create v1.1.0 \
  --title "v1.1.0: Major expansion with new pipelines" \
  --notes-file RELEASE_NOTES_v1.1.0.md \
  --prerelease  # omit for stable release
```

### 3. Update Existing Release (if needed)

If you need to improve release notes for an existing release:

```bash
# Update release notes
gh release edit v1.1.0 \
  --notes-file RELEASE_NOTES_v1.1.0.md

# Or via web interface:
# Go to the release page and click "Edit release"
```

## Post-Release Tasks

### 1. Update Main Branch

Ensure `CHANGELOG.md` and any documentation updates are on the main branch:

```bash
git checkout main
git merge --no-ff release-branch
git push origin main
```

### 2. Update Installation Instructions

Verify that installation instructions work:

```bash
# Test pip installation
python3 -m pip install "git+https://github.com/impresso/impresso-make-cookbook.git@v1.1.0#subdirectory=lib"

# Test in Pipfile
# impresso-cookbook = {git = "https://github.com/impresso/impresso-make-cookbook.git", ref = "v1.1.0", subdirectory = "lib"}
```

### 3. Announce Release

- [ ] Update project documentation website (if applicable)
- [ ] Notify team members
- [ ] Post in relevant communication channels
- [ ] Update any deployment automation

### 4. Monitor for Issues

After release:
- Monitor GitHub issues for bug reports
- Check discussion forums or communication channels
- Be prepared to create patch releases if critical bugs are found

## Hotfix Releases

For critical bug fixes:

1. Create a hotfix branch from the release tag:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b hotfix/1.1.1 v1.1.0
   ```

2. Make the fix and test thoroughly

3. Create a patch release:
   ```bash
   git tag -a v1.1.1 -m "Hotfix: Description of critical fix"
   git push origin v1.1.1
   ```

4. Create release with focused release notes on the fix

5. Merge hotfix back to main:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge --no-ff hotfix/1.1.1
   git push origin main
   ```
