# consolidatedcanonical Configuration
# Defines S3 and local paths for consolidatedcanonical processing
#
# This module consolidates canonical newspaper data with language identification
# and OCR quality assessment enrichments to produce consolidated canonical format.
#
# PATH STRUCTURE:
# ==============
# Consolidated canonical mirrors the canonical structure with a VERSION prefix:
#
# Canonical:    s3://112-canonical-final/CANONICAL_PATH_SEGMENT/issues/
# Consolidated: s3://118-canonical-consolidated-final/VERSION/CANONICAL_PATH_SEGMENT/issues/
#
# Where CANONICAL_PATH_SEGMENT can be:
#   - PROVIDER/NEWSPAPER (e.g., BL/WTCH) when NEWSPAPER_HAS_PROVIDER=1
#   - NEWSPAPER (e.g., WTCH) when NEWSPAPER_HAS_PROVIDER=0
#
# Input sources:
# - Canonical issues: s3://112-canonical-final/CANONICAL_PATH_SEGMENT/issues/
# - Langident enrichments: s3://115-canonical-processed-final/langident/RUN_ID/CANONICAL_PATH_SEGMENT/
#
# Output:
# - Consolidated issues: s3://118-canonical-consolidated-final/VERSION/CANONICAL_PATH_SEGMENT/issues/
